# Appalachian Gravel Growler
## Presented by Bikepacking.com
This bikepacking route is a short tour of Western North Carolina that goes through some of the nicest National Forests in the area as well as having a few drink stops on the way.  Asheville is the main attraction with this route because of the proximity to lots of National Forest land and because of the high concentration of breweries in the area.  The purpose of this map was to have a stand alone webpage that would highlight the route in question as well as markers designating simple information that may be beneficial to the viewer.  These markers could be places to camp, warnings for highly trafficked areas, or just the name of a local brewery.  By adding a short description from Bikepacking.com and a few other characteristics of the route, the reader would have the base level of information where they could then transfer to the website for a full overview of the route.  The data came from RideWithGPS where the author of the article Logan Watts created a route using that software.  I then used that GPX. file to put itself into a web format.
